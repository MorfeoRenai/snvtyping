Description: 
    The goal of `snvtyping` is to preprocess and analyze VCF files containing
    SNV mutations, by getting the genomic context of all of its Single
    Nucleotide Variants mutations. It can also classify group them by type of
    SNV, by type of context and then plot their frequency.
